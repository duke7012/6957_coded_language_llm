COMMENTS:  When this “Dictionary” was first started, it was done primarily as an aid for the 
Security Threat Group Officers in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ).  This 
“Dictionary” has since continued to grow from approximately 30 pages in 12-pitch font to this 
monster of 168 pages in 11-pitch font.   
     The gangs, cliques and other groups continue to change the meaning and usage of their words in 
an attempt to mislead authorities in what they are attempting to accomplish.  This book only 
succeeds with the help of everyone who receives a copy of it. Currently we mostly utilized 
interpretations by the Security Threat Group Officers assigned throughout TDCJ. We are also 
using other sources, which include the Attorney General’s gang web site and others. 
     What we wish to do is incorporate information from any person or agency that has located or 
confirmed words or signs that are unique to a given set or group.  This in turn will allow everyone 
to benefit from this information.  If you have something of interest that you feel should be included 
in the “Dictionary,” please send it to us at the following:
